This project is a clone made from my previous project that was done in C# (see reference https://github.com/toody-hd/Demo-Project) with the purpose of Java learning.
The whole project was made from scratch without any knowledge on how Java works, the duration of this work was one month in which I learned how to use Java and developed this application.
